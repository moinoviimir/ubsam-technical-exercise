# ubsam-technical-exercise
This is the solution to a technical exercise provided by EPAM for an UBS position.
I would like to use this space to explain some of the design decisions I've made concerning the implementation:
- I didn't introduce a DI container, instead relying on poor-man's DI. Some entities (`AddStockViewModel`, particularly) violate it somewhat; this is because I ran out of any and all of the allocated time. And well past that.
- While the Domain model has a basic implementation that should be capable of dealing with fairly large data arrays, it has not been tested to actually be able to. The .UI implementation forgoes these concerns, focusing on providing functionality without too many checks
- There is no real exception handling model in the solution; an exception is thrown and caught for validation purposes, but it's fairly mediocre design at best. It's pretty much only there because I couldn't let a constructor create an incorrect state for the entity.
- I'm certain the WPF binding part can be done more elegantly, given better acquaintance with WPF. My experience with the framework, however, dates back a few years, and I couldn't revive that much of it given the limited time.
- While the Domain Model has been developed in the spirit of TDD, the UI has not. ViewModels that have behaviourend up being tested, but not exactly in the TDD way. The sole reason for that is that I am, unfortunately, out of time. Given my currently limited WPF skills, I had to forgo TDD for the UI project in the interest of short-term temporal gain. That was not an easy decision for me, and I understand that it will make your job, esteemed reviewer, somewhat harder, but there isn't much I could do. If anything, frankly. Time constraints are cruel.

That's it, I guess. Thank you for your time.

P.S. Some known issues include the Grid displaying currency in a different locale than the input fields and the design of the right panel being off -- it takes too much space to display its very limited information. I am aware of these quirks, but, at the risk of tiring you out by reiterating it, I am rather out of time.
